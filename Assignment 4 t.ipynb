    "Mutability: Tuples are immutable, which means their elements cannot be modified after creation. Once a tuple is created, you cannot add, remove, or modify its elements. In contrast, lists are mutable, allowing you to add, remove, or modify elements freely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax: Tuples are defined using parentheses () or without any delimiters, separating elements with commas. For example, (1, 2, 3) or 1, 2, 3 are valid tuples. Lists, on the other hand, are defined using square brackets []. For example, [1, 2, 3] is a valid list.\n",

    "Performance: Tuples are generally more memory-efficient and faster to access than lists. Since tuples are immutable, Python can optimize their storage and perform certain operations more efficiently. Lists, being mutable, require additional memory allocations and overhead for dynamic resizing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usage: Tuples are typically used for collections of heterogeneous data, where each element has a specific meaning or represents a different entity. For example, storing coordinates as (x, y) or representing a person's information as ('John', 25, 'USA'). Lists, on the other hand, are commonly used for collections of homogeneous data, where elements are of the same type and order matters. For example, a list of numbers [1, 2, 3] or a list of names ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'].\n",

    "Common Operations: Both tuples and lists support common operations like indexing and slicing. However, since tuples are immutable, you cannot use operations that modify elements, such as appending or removing items. Lists have additional methods like append(), extend(), and remove() that allow for dynamic changes.Ans "
